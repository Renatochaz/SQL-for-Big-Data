# Learn SQL for Big Data environments

This repository builds on the content available at the course of Big Data with MySQL. My aim here is to consolidate the knowledge, point at fundamental topics needed to work with SQL in a Data Science context and build a place with aggregated knowledge of SQL to consult when needed.

If you want a more in depth explanation of everything explained at this repository, please go to [Link to course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/analytics-mysql).
